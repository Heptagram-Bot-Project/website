## ✏ Discord Server

Heptagram has a community Discord server. You can join it at [https://discord.gg/pKmY7jsp4E](https://discord.gg/pKmY7jsp4E). In the server you can suggest features, talk with developers, and test out the bot for yourself. If you have made an Open Source Contribution, you can gain access to a special role and channels. To do so, join the server and then ping any admin and let them know.
